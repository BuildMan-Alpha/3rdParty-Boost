Boost Notes:

As of 1.74.0, (possibly sooner) Boost has a separate source file install and installers for each 
VS library.

The build Alpha Anywhere build scripts assume the libraries and DLLs are all in stage\lib.

1. Download the new source files and install them.
2. Download the 32-bit versions of all of the VS files needed (currently 141 and 142) and install them. under the root of the installed source 
	(strip off any path to just the root of the current version).
3. To be safe, download and install the 64-bit versions as well.
4. Copy the lib and DLL files for each variant of 32/64-bit and v141/142 (and whatever comes afterwared to stage\lib under the installed source root.
	Note that they will each have a libxxxxxxx directory.
